Automation Life Cycle:


1. Identify the need for automation
			|
			V
2. Get customer approval
			|
			V
3. Perform tool Evaluation
In interview tell that the tool was already standardized in our organization.
[Ex:
Selenium, UFT, Test Complete, Sahi, Watir, Tosca,
Kalalon, Cypress, Browser stack, PlayWright etc]
			|
			V
4. Idetify the Critical Regression test cases & Create a First Draft of the framework
			|
			V
5. Setup a meeting for POC (Proof Of Concept). All the automation people, BA, Managers etc from the division will attend the meeting
			|
			V
6. Evaluate the review comments & accept the required ones & fix the review comments in your framework.
			|
			V
7. Place the framework into the git repository & ask the remaing people to take the framework form the repository (clone the repository)
			|
			V
8. Identify the Regression test cases which can be automated and add them to the automation Suite
			|
			V
9. Convert the identified regression test cases into Automation test scripts by writing methods & test scripts.
			|
			V
10. After completion of coding, Perform dry run and make sure the code is working as expected + All the coding standards are followed. 
Send for code review through version control tools [pull Request(PR)] (Ex: GitHub, bitBucket, gitLab, SVN, perforse etc)
			|
			V
11. The reviewer will provide the review comments If required.
Fix all the review comments and create a pull Request(PR). If every thing is fine, then your code will me merged into main branch in the verison control tool.
			|
			V
12. Whenever build comes, checkout the framework from the version control tool & execute the framework against the each builds
			| (Execution flow will be followed)
			V
13. Create a consolidated Automation test execution report & share with all stake holders
