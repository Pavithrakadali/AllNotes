Sikuli: It is a independent functional testing tool. It supports both window and web applications.
It identifies the elements based on the images. Hence it is a image based tool.
As it is a image based tool, it is highly pixel sensitive.

It understands jython (java + Python).

Advantages:
1. It works for any kind of application.

Dis-advantags:
1. It is highly pixel sensitive
2. It doesnot work in a virtual computer. It requires active and physical computer.
3. for different browsers we need different images to be captured.
