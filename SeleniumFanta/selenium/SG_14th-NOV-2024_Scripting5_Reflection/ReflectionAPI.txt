Reflection:
  It is a process of inspecting OR modifying the runtime behaviour of a class at runtime is k.a., Reflection.
Ex:  methods, classes, interfaces, constructor


Note: 
1. One advantage of reflection API in Java is, it can manipulate private members of the class too.
2. Most of the reflection members are checked exception. Hence try catch is required.
3. Reflection belongs to java.lang.reflect package
--------------------------------

It can be achieved in 3 ways:

I. By creating object to the class. This is used for instance members
 <className> <obj> = new <Constructor>();

II. by running static block alone
Class cls = Class.forName(<pkgName.className>);

III. By using Object class
Class cls = Class.forName(<pkgName.className>);
Object obj = cls.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
-------------------------------

I. By creating instance to the class
 <className> <obj> = new <Constructor>();
