9. How to apply Style attributes?
   CSS (Cascading Style Sheet):
   CSS is used to define the style to the html elements.
   
Syntax: 
style="<attributrName>:<attributeValue>"

Different ways of defining CSS:

(a) Inline Approach: Defining the style within the each tag indicates inline approach.
Drawbacks:
1. No reusability
2. more line of codes


(b) Internal Approach: Defining the styles inside the <head> section of the each html pages by using <style> tag.

Here we use id & class attributes to defferenciate the tags uniquely.
# - id
. - class

Advantages:
1. Reusability within the same page

Drawbacks:
1. No reusability between the pages


(c) External Approach: defining the style attributes in the external files. The file extension should be .css
This external file will be called inside the html page whereever required. Thus increases the reusability within & as well as between the pages.
