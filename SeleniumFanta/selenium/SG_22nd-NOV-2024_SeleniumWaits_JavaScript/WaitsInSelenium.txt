Selenium waits
It is used to establish the sync between script speed and application rendering speed.


Types of waits:
In selenium there are 3 types of waits.
1. Implicit waits
2. Explicit waits
3. Fluent Wait

1. Implicit waits: It is a hardcoded wait. The wait lasts for the given number of periods.

(a) pageLoadTimeout:
Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before throwing an error.

(b) implicitlyWait:
Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present.

(c) setScriptTimeout:
Sets the amount of time to wait for an asynchronous script to finish execution before throwing an error.

(d) Thread.sleep()
----------------------------------

2. Explicit waits: These are the dynamic waits. Once the condition is achieved then it will skip waits for the remaing period of time.
Ex: Waiting for the element to load for 10 sec, but element loaded within 2 sec. Then dynamic waits will skip the remaining 8 sec.

(a) WebDriverWait class
-------------------------------------------
3. Fluent Wait:

Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(oBrowser)
		.withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(40))
		.pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
		.ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath("")));

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.textToBePresentInElementLocated(By.xpath(""), "<text>"));
