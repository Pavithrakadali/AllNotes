Regression testing:

1.definition
2.t is usually performed after code changes or enhancements have been made and before the software is released to production.
3.Regression testing aims to cover a broad spectrum of the application's functionality, often through automated testing tools and scripts.
4. It can be performed multiple times during the software development life cycle, particularly during integration testing, system testing, and before releases.

sanity

def
2.It is usually performed early in the testing phase, often after a new build or version of the software is received, to quickly assess its basic functionality.
3. It targets critical functionalities or areas affected by recent changes.
4.It is typically performed at the beginning of a testing cycle, such as after a build is received from development, to ensure that the software is stable enough for further testing.

smoke
1.def
2.Smoke testing is usually conducted after a new build is received, before more extensive testing is carried out. If the smoke test fails, further testing is halted until the issues are resolved
3.Similar to sanity testing, smoke testing targets critical functionalities, but it is more comprehensive and covers a wider range of features.
4.It is performed early in the testing process to quickly assess the stability of the software build and determine whether it is suitable for further testing
