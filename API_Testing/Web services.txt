Web services
-> Web Services is the mechanism or the medium of communication through which two 
   applications / machines will exchange the data irrespective of their underlying technology
-> Web services help 2 application exchange information with each other when application 
   running in same or different platform.
-> Any service available on web is called webservice
-> All Web service are API , but all API are not webservice 
-> WebService help us to share the functionality of one application to any other application 
   without sharing the source code & database data, even though both application running in 
   same or different platform

What is SOAP web services?
-> SOAP is a simple XML-based protocol to let applications exchange information.
-> SOAP it uses XML to exchange information between applications.
-> SOAP provides a way to communicate between applications running on different operating 
   systems, with different technologies and programming languages.
-> SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
-> SOAP is a communication protocol
-> SOAP is for communication between applications
-> SOAP communicates via Internet
-> SOAP is platform independent
-> SOAP is based on XML
-> Tool used is SOAP-UI

What is WSDL
-> An WSDL(Web services description Language) document describes a soap web service.

Soap WebService API Testing
-> When two  application exchange information via soap protocol,  which is xml based  , 
   testing those request and response is called Soap webservice testing
-> SOAP Webserive exposed via .wsdl file
-> EG : SOAP API

What is Rest
-> REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
-> It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the  client 
   a representation of the state of the request 
-> REST is an architectural style for developing web services. 
-> REST is popular due to its simplicity and the fact that it builds upon existing 
   systems and features of the internet's http resource.
-> A Restful system consists of a:
   - client who requests for the resources.
   - server who has the resources

Why JSON is Popular in RestFull Webservice 
-> Java Script Object Notation
-> It’s a Programing language to exchange information between 2 application
-> The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
-> JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
-> All Browser & Mobile UI can easily consume json language
-> NO SQL databases can directly store the data in the from of JSON (MangoDb, Casendra )
-> Platform independent

RestFull WebSerive Api Testing
-> When two  application exchange information via http protocol  , which is based 
   json/xml/text/html , testing those request and response is called Rest webservcie testing
-> Rest API Webserice are exposed via URI/URL
-> EG :  Rest API

Difference between SOAP/ Rest
SOAP  Web Service	
SOAP is a protocol	
Simple Object Access Protocol	
SOAP can't use REST Web services, it is a protocol	
SOAP expose the  services (Business Logic) via .WSDL file     	
SOAP designed using too much standards	
SOAP permits XML data format only	
SOAP requires more bandwidth and resources	
SOAP d¬efines its own security	
Less preferred than REST	

Rest Web Service
REST is Architectural style
Representational State Transfer
REST can use soap as well since it is concept
REST expose the service (Business Logic) via URI 
REST does not define too much standards
REST permits different data formats- Plain text, html, JSON, XML ,JS
REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP
Inherits security measures from underlined transport Protocol (ouath-1.0  outh-2.0 , Bearer token)
REST more preferred than SOAP

Advantages of Web Service 
1. Web Services Interoperability (WS-I)
2. Each application is independent of one another. Hence changes done to one application 
   will not impact the "unrelated areas"
3. No need of re-inventing the wheel
   Ex: Uber / OLA can make use of Google Maps 
4. Business Opportunity
5. Service Reuse

What is API Testing? - API Testing is done by Testers/SDETs
1. API testing is a type of software testing where application programming interfaces (APIs) 
   are tested to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, 
   performance, and security.
2. Testing the application in Source code layer (Business layer) is called API testing 
3. Testing interface between two Application is also called API testing
4. Testing is done without browser is called API testing
